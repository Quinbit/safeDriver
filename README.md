# Drive Safe

This project is designed to be a universally applicable self driving assistant. 

It is intended to act as an emergency turning and breaking system for whenever the car is about to crash into another object. It uses machine vision to estimate the depth of upcoming objects and acts accordingly. It is designed to be able to be plugged directly into the bus of any vehicle
